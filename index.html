  <h2 class="topd">Top Refugee & Asylum Seeker Populations</h2>
  <p class="desc">By Suhail Parkar · June 2025</p>
  <p class="desc">
    We visualize global refugee and asylum seeker populations from 2023 and 2024, using two popular chart types: a treemap and a horizontal stacked bar chart. Each chart aims to represent the same data but in different ways. Which one gives you the bigger picture?

  <div class="controls">
    <label for="yearselect">Select Year:</label>
    <select id="yearselect" class="controlinput"></select>

    <label for="refugeeslider">Minimum Total Refugees:</label>
    <input type="range" id="refugeeslider" class="controlinput" min="0" step="1000" />

    <h3 class="topd">Tree Map</h3>
    <div id="treemap"></div>
    <p class="desc">
      Treemaps use area size to show total volume, fitting many countries into a compact rectangle. This gives a quick visual impression of scale, where larger boxes dominate attention.
      It's a powerful tool for showing all data at once, especially when screen space is limited. But smaller countries become tiny squares readable only through tooltips, not labels.
      Also, human eyes are less effective at comparing areas than lengths, so it's harder to judge small differences between countries with similar totals.
    </p>

    <h3 class="topd">Bar Chart</h3>
    <div id="barchart"></div>
    <p class="desc">
      Bar charts are excellent for precise comparisons. Countries are ranked top-down by total refugee and asylum seeker count, making it immediately obvious which countries contribute the most.
      The use of two colors (e.g., blue for refugees, orange for asylum seekers) within each bar makes it easy to compare not just totals, but proportional breakdowns.
      However, once we go beyond the top 10 or 20 countries, the chart becomes long or scrollable, limiting the overview of all contributors.

  <h3 class="topd">Line Chart</h3>
  <div id="linechart" class="linec">
    <h3 class="topd">Refugees & Asylum Seekers (2023–2024)</h3>
  </div>
  <p class="desc">
    This animated line chart visualizes the annual number of refugees and asylum seekers arriving in Australia, Canada, France, Italy, and the United States from 2023 to 2024.
    Each country is represented by a distinct pair of lines—one for refugees and one for asylum seekers—providing a clear view of their respective trends over time.
  </p>
  <p class="desc">
    Due to the wide variation in values between countries (e.g., the U.S. receiving over 80,000 individuals, while others remain below 20,000), a logarithmic (log) scale was applied to the vertical axis.
    This transformation helps compress large differences in values, ensuring that lower value countries are still visually distinct and not overshadowed. It allows for a more meaningful comparison across countries without sacrificing visibility or interpretability.
